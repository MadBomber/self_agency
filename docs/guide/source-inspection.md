# Source Inspection

`_source_for` returns the source code for any method -- both LLM-generated and file-defined methods.

## Instance-Level Inspection

Call `_source_for` on an instance to retrieve source code:

```ruby
class MathHelper
  include SelfAgency

  # Multiplies a number by two.
  def double(n)
    n * 2
  end
end

helper = MathHelper.new
helper._("an instance method named 'square' that accepts an integer n and returns n * n")
```

For LLM-generated methods, `_source_for` returns the code with the original description as a comment header:

```ruby
puts helper._source_for(:square)
# >> # an instance method named 'square' that accepts an integer n and returns n * n
# >> def square(n)
# >>   n * n
# >> end
```

## Class-Level Inspection

`_source_for` is also available as a class method:

```ruby
puts MathHelper._source_for(:square)
# >> # an instance method named 'square' that accepts an integer n and returns n * n
# >> def square(n)
# >>   n * n
# >> end
```

Both instance and class level lookups return the same source for LLM-generated methods.

## File-Defined Methods

For methods defined in source files (not generated by the LLM), `_source_for` falls back to the `method_source` gem. It includes any comments directly above the method definition:

```ruby
puts helper._source_for(:double)
# >> # Multiplies a number by two.
# >> def double(n)
# >>   n * 2
# >> end
```

## Unknown Methods

If a method doesn't exist or its source is unavailable, `_source_for` returns `nil`:

```ruby
helper._source_for(:nonexistent)  #=> nil
```

## How It Works

`_source_for` checks two sources in order:

1. **LLM-generated source** -- Stored in an internal hash when `_()` creates the method
2. **File source** -- Falls back to `method_source` gem for methods defined in `.rb` files

If both lookups fail (method doesn't exist or source file can't be located), `nil` is returned.
